# React Hooks 

This is the chapter that is the main chapter.

## `useState` hook tests

This is the hook for functional components to save local state. This state is the best state and then the things are not here. When the things are not done and then they seem to happen. 

``` javascript
const a = 0;
const b = 20;

const c = a + b; 
console.log(c);

function help(object) {
  console.log(object)
}
```

## useEffect hook

This is a different hook than use state hook which is used to make side effects come up. The side effect is caused when the component is mounted and unmounted.
